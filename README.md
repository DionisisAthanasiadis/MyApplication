# MyApplication
Design of a mobile application using app design methodologies.

The design should be for an application that will function as an agenda. Your system will be an app intended for use via smartphones. Each user will have the ability to create a new account. Once logged in, the user can create new appointments by specifying the title and description, and within the description, they can include the date, start time, and duration of the meeting. The creator of the appointment will have the ability to access a list and view their appointments, and if they are not satisfied with what they have created in the list, they will be able to recreate a new list from scratch.
